# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail_dataset <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)

num_pattern <- "(\\d+\\s)?(\\d+((\\/|\\.)\\d+)?)"
unit_pattern <- "(dash|dashes|drop|drops|oz|bsp)"
percent_pattern <- "(\\(\\d+(\\.\\d+)?%\\sabv\\))"
clean_regex <- paste0(num_pattern, "\\s", unit_pattern, "\\s|\\s", percent_pattern)

cleaned_dataset <- cocktail_dataset %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>|<b4/>|<br>") %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, clean_regex)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients)) %>%
  distinct(name, ingredients, .keep_all = TRUE)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}

ingredient_list <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  distinct(ingredients) %>%
  arrange(ingredients) %>%
  pull(ingredients)

print(ingredient_list)

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}

number_of_ingredients <- length(ingredient_list)

print(number_of_ingredients)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}

ingredient_frequency <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE)

top_10_ingredients <- ingredient_frequency %>%
  filter(n >= top_n(ingredient_frequency, 10)$n[10])

print(top_10_ingredients)

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}

cocktails_with_most_ingredients <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  count(name, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n == max(n))

print(cocktails_with_most_ingredients)

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}

rare_ingredients <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n == 1) %>%
  pull(ingredients)

print(rare_ingredients)
print(length(rare_ingredients))

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

cocktails_with_rare_ingredient <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredients) %>%
  distinct(name) %>%
  arrange(name) %>%
  pull(name)

print(cocktails_with_rare_ingredient)

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}

cocktails_without_rare_ingredients <- setdiff(
  cocktail_dataset %>% distinct(name) %>% arrange(name) %>% pull(name),
  cocktails_with_rare_ingredient
  )

print(cocktails_without_rare_ingredients)

```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}

cocktail_cheat_sheet <- 
  cleaned_dataset %>% 
  mutate(present = "X") %>%
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = name,
    names_from = ingredients,
    values_from = present
  ) %>%
  mutate_all(~replace_na(., ""))

# Prettify the matrix
cheat_sheet <- cocktail_cheat_sheet %>%
  arrange(name) %>%
  select(name, sort(setdiff(names(cocktail_cheat_sheet), "name")))

knitr::kable(cheat_sheet)

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
